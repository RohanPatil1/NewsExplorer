# About 
NewsExplorer is a news app that shows news articles from all around the world. The Discover screen
lets users read news of several categories. It efficiently handles api calls by fetching news
everyday 8AM & caching the data so the user can instantly see the news when they open the app.
Lastly, there is also a Widget Version of NewsExplorer which too, gets updated with the same
convenience.
